History
===========

## 2015-07-03

 * wifo3-2 installed with peaches drives and 4 lemon drives;
 * copied data from peaches onto lemons
 * checked data with md5

## 2015-07-08

 * removed peaches drives; added 5 more lemon drives (total lemon drives see above)
 * Added remaining lemons with,
   `mdadm --grow /dev/md/lemons --raid-devices=8 --add /dev/sd[abcdi]1`
 * this leaves one drive as a spare
 * Unfortunately I forgot to also set `--level=raid6` when I did this, will need to revisit this
 * This results in (from `cat /proc/mdstat`),
   ```
   md127 : active raid5 sdi1[9] sdd1[8] sdc1[7] sdb1[6] sda1[5](S) sdh1[4] sdg1[2] sde1[0] sdf1[1]
      11720647680 blocks super 1.2 level 5, 512k chunk, algorithm 2 [8/8] [UUUUUUUU]
   ```
   
 * Tuned filesystem for raid parameters,
   * Following https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_setup#ext2.2C_ext3.2C_and_ext4
   * chunk size = 512kB (from `mdstat`)
   * block size = 4kB (from `tune2fs -l`)
   * stride = chunk size / block size = 128
   * raid_devices = 8 (from `mdstat`)
   * stripe width = stride * (raid_devices - 2) = 768 (for raid6)
   * set with (after unmounting),
     `tune2fs -E stride=128,stripe-width=768 /dev/md/lemons1`
     
 * What next:
   * Up the raid level to raid6 and add a write-intent bitmap:
     `mdadm /dev/md/lemons --grow --level=raid6 --bitmap=internal`
   * grow the partition to fill the new space: `parted /dev/md/lemons resizepart 1 -1` (need to check this)
   * grow the filesystem in the partition: `resize2fs /dev/md/lemons1`

  * can view the status of the md volume with `cat /proc/mdstat`
